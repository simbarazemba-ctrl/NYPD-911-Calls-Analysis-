NYPD 911 Calls for Service Analysis (2023–2024)

This project analyzes the NYPD 911 Calls for Service (Historic) dataset from NYC Open Data, comprising approximately 12 million records and 20 variables. The objective was to evaluate operational workload patterns and identify inefficiencies in emergency response distribution across boroughs.


Project Workflow

Data Cleaning & Preparation

-Removed irrelevant or low-value columns

-Handled missing and inconsistent entries

-Standardized date/time and categorical fields

-Optimized structure for analysis and visualization


Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

-Assessed overall call volume trends

-Identified peak hours, high-demand days, and seasonal patterns

-Compared borough-level disparities in call distribution

-Examined proportions of non-criminal vs. criminal incidents


Dashboard Development

-Designed KPI-driven visualizations in Tableau

-Built an interactive dashboard to highlight:

-Call volume trends

-Borough workload imbalances

-Peak demand periods

-Non-criminal call share


Key Objective

To support data-informed resource allocation and operational planning by identifying workload imbalances, peak demand patterns, and areas where emergency response efficiency can be improved.

This project demonstrates end-to-end analytical workflow skills: large-scale data cleaning, structured exploratory analysis, KPI design, and executive-level dashboard communication.
